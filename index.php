			<h4>POKHARA</h4>
			<div class="row">
				
				
					<p class="pokhara">Pokhara is Nepal's number 1 adventure and leisure city, 
			           a trekking gateway to the 
					Annapurna's with plenty of entertainment 
						for individual travellers as well as families with kids. 
					In Pokhara you can experience the best in trekking, boating, hiking, pony rides, paragliding or simply relax at one of the lakes near the city with the stunning Annapurna mountain range at the background.
				
					</p>  
	`				<p class="pokhara">Pokhara will overwhelm you with one of the greatest photo spots in the world. 
					While you walk along the shores of the Fewa lake you will be surrounded by a panoramical view over  the Himalayan peaks of the Annapurna Massif that reflect in this lake. A beautiful color combination that is created by the wooden boats and paragliders that are sailing, flying and rowing over the lake is probably going to be one of the highlights of your travel experience in Nepal. 
					</p>	
				
					<p class="pokhara">Pokhara is well-known as a starting point for various trekking trail and expeditions in the Annapurna . Most of the hikers and trekkers for Annapurna and Ghandruk, respectively, build Pokhara as their first stop, or as relaxing station before they head out for serious walking. So, one may enjoy boating and reading books observing the serenity of the nature, or enjoy a couple of drinks, either in local restaurants or at a blues bar, or may simply enjoy sightseeing or cycling around the city.

		<h4>MUSTANG</h4>
		<div class="row">	
				<p class="pokhara">Mustang (from the Tibetan möntang (Wylie: smon-thang), Nepali: मुस्तांग "fertile plain"), formerly Kingdom of Lo, is a remote and isolated region of the Nepalese Himalayas. The Upper Mustang was a restricted demilitarized area until 1992 which makes it one of the most preserved regions in the world, with a majority of the population still speaking traditional Tibetic languages. Tibetan culture has been preserved by the relative isolation of the region from the outside world.
				</p>  
	`			<p class="pokhara">The Upper Mustang comprise the northern two-thirds of Mustang District of Dhawalagiri Zone, Nepal. The southern third of the district is called Thak and is the homeland of the Thakali, who speak the Thakali language, and whose culture combines Tibetan and Nepalese elements. Life in Mustang revolves around tourism, animal husbandry and trade.
				</p>	
				
				<p class="pokhara">To trek in Upper Mustang is a rare privilege. Here you will experience the way of life of true mountain people, who were not much in touch with the rest of Nepal for hundreds of years, and even until recent times had an officially recognized king. In many ways, a trek into Upper Mustang is similar to trekking in Tibet, as geographically it is a part of the Tibetan plateau. The district of Mustang was, until 1950, a separate kingdom within the boundaries of Nepal. The last king, the Raja of Mustang, still has his home in the ancient capital known as Lo Manthang.

				<p>There are other many places in Nepal that represent Nepal rich in natural beauties, historical, 
				religious and cultural activities. Places such as Lumbini, Pashupatinath Temple, Swoyambhu, Royal Chitwan National Park and other National parks, Conservation areas also play important role in increasing national income of the country by the help of their immense beauties and importances. Being a Nepali, we should visit different parts of our country. 
				Also, we should go to different places where people haven't reached. We should make our country glow in the world. </p>
